## 📖 Overview
**VoiceAccess** is a specialized web-based audio library designed specifically for visually impaired and color-blind university students. Traditional digital libraries rely on keyboards and mice, which are significant barriers for blind users. 

VoiceAccess eliminates these hardware dependencies by introducing a **"Contactless Interaction Model"** using **Face Recognition** for security and **Hand Gestures** for navigation.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🔐 Biometric Authentication (FaceID)
- Replaces traditional typed passwords with **Face Recognition**.
- Uses `face-api.js` to securely verify users via webcam directly in the browser.
- **94% Success Rate** in testing environments.

### 2. ✋ Contactless Gesture Navigation
- Powered by **Google MediaPipe Hands**.
- Allows students to browse books, play/pause audio, and select categories using simple hand signs (e.g., Index Finger Up, Open Palm).
- **Zero-touch interface** removes the need for a mouse.

### 3. 🎨 Adaptive UI for Color Blindness
- Includes an integrated **Ishihara Color Vision Test**.
- Automatically detects color blindness (Protanopia/Deuteranopia) and applies **SVG/CSS filters** to adjust the interface colors for better visibility.

### 4. 🧠 Smart Book Recommendations
- Uses a **Content-Based Filtering Algorithm**.
- Suggests audiobooks based on the student's study field (Faculty) and listening history.
